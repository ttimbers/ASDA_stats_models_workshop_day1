# ASDA Statistical Models Workshop (day 1)
Github repository for ASDA stats models workshop (day 1) for ECOSCOPE. Day 1 consists of a short lesson/discussion on experimental design, and then a more lengthy, hands on lesson on Analysis of Variance in R.


### Materials (code & slides)
- [day 1](workshop1#workshop-1-experimental-design--anova)

### Suggested guidelines on how to use these materials:

1. Go over the 3 major points in the slides for experimental design, discussing and filling in more details than are currently in the slides at the workshop. Ideally, the learners will  help drive the discussion. Next, use the first 3 questions from the challenge slides to drive the thoughts and discussions further. Estimated time: ~ 20-30 min.

2. Go through all the ANOVA slides and then do the ANOVA true/false questions from the challenge slides. Estimated time: 20-30 min.

3. Present the R code from the [ANOVA.Rmd file](workshop1/ANOVA.Rmd) via either live coding or by copying and pasting from the Rmd file (depends on the coding capabilities and experience of of the learners). As you do this, talk through the narration in the .Rmd to explain the code. Intersperse the challenge questions as follows:
  - pause after  1-way ANOVA with > 2 groups to do the iris data 1-way ANOVA challenge question (second to last challenge question in slides)
  - end with the final challenge question after I completed presenting all the code.

Estimated time: ~ 60 min.
